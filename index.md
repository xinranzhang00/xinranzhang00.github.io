My name is Xinran Zhang. I am a first year Ph.D. student of Information Science and Technology at Penn State University, advised by Professor [Vasant Honavar](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/vuh14).
I earned a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
Prior to this, I studied Philosophy and Computer Science in Lafayette College, advised by Professor [Jia Tao](https://sites.lafayette.edu/taoj/). 

My research focuses on logical systems and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR).
I am interested in Argumentation and Neuro-symbolic AI, aiming to enhance the ability of intelligent systems to perform structured reasoning and support complex decision-making.
In addition, I am keen to explore how concepts from philosophy, such as fairness and justification, can be combined with computational models, in order to enrich both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications of AI.
