My name is Xinran Zhang. 
I recently graduated with a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Prior to this, I studied Philosophy and Computer Science in Lafayette College. 

My research interests fall in the Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Philosophy of Language.
My research focuses on logical systems and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
In the future, I would also like to study on Argumentation within AI, aiming to enhance the ability of systems to engage in structured reasoning and
decision-making processes.
